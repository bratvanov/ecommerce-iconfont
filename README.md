# eCommerce Icon Font
Logos for credit cards, payment methods and gateways, cryptocurrencies and many other eCommerce related brands in an icon font or SVG format.

## Icon Font Usage

Refer to the *demo.html* and *demo.css* files for instructions and examples.

The font contains 64 icons and weighs just 33-38kb for the WOFF2 or WOFF formats respectively.

You can re-generate the font with only the icons that you need by importing the *src/fontello.json* file to [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) if you want to further reduce its size.

## SVG Pack and Source

All icons are available in a single, organised and layered SVG file - *src/all.svg* which you can use for a reference.

The exported individual SVG icons, optimised with [SVGO](//github.com/svg/svgo) and ready for web use can be found in the *svg/* directory. These are useful when you need to apply the logos as background images in the CSS.

The source SVG as well as the individual SVG icons can be modified with a vector graphics editor such as Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW or Inkscape.
